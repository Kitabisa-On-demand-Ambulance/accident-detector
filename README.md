# accident-detector

This is part of Machine Learning development. Here we develop a model to verify photos uploaded by users. The model creation process can be seen in final model tflite.ipynb. For models deployed to the app, it has been converted to tflite and can be seen at converted_model.tflite. We are in the stage of developing an OCR model to extract the text on the ID card and analyze the data using heat maps.
